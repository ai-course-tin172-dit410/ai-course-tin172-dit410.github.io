# AI lecture slides

Presentation slides for a course in Artificial Intelligence, 
based on publicly available slides by
Poole & Mackworth, 2010 (<http://artint.info/slides/>), 
and Russell & Norvig, 2005 (<http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/>)


The slides are written in Markdown and generated to HTML presentation
using hakimel's [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).
I've been inspired by admhlt's skeleton [jekyll-and-slide](https://github.com/admhlt/jekyll-and-slide).

Keyboard bindings:

- 'Esc': overview of all slides
- 'S': enter speaker notes
- 'F': fullscreen mode
- 'B': pause the presentation (turn screen black)

You can also use tabs, an optimal solution to save space on your slides. <a href="https://aexmachina.github.io/tabcordion/">Tabaccordion</a> example on js.

To print/export to PDF, open the slides in Chrome and add `?print-pdf` to the URL,
[as described here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export).
